# This Dockerfile builds invoicer twice for any given platform (<os>-<architecture> combo, ex: `linux-amd64`) - once on
#   Alpine and once on Debian.  After the build completes both binaries are compared.  If identical, the result
#   binary is stripped, and moved to a final stage that's ready to be uploaded to Docker Hub or Github Registry.
