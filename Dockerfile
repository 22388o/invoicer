## Build invoicer binary.
#   The first line gets hash of the last git-commit & second one prints it.
#   And here's all other flags explained:
#       `-x` [verbocity++] print all executed commands
#       `-v` [verbocity++] print names of compiled packages
#       `-mod=readonly` [reproducibility] do not change versions of used packages no matter what
#       `-trimpath` [reproducibility] make sure absolute paths are not included anywhere in the binary
#       `-tags` [reproducibility] tell Go to build a static binary, see more: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26492
#       `-ldflags`
#           `-s` [size--] do not include symbol table and debug info
#           `-w` [size--] do not include DWARF symbol table
#           `-buildid` [reproducibility] while this should always be the same in our setup, clear it just-in-case
#           `-X` [info] is used twice to inject version, and git-hash into the built binary
#
#   NOTE: all of this has to happen in a single `RUN`, because it's impossible to set ENV var in Docker to
#       an output of an expression.
